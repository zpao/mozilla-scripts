# Be Warned

Some of these will have destructive & irreversible actions. You will probably not have any warning other than comments or the name of the script (hint: "remove" will remove things!)


# Usage

All of these can be run from the error console or scratchpad.

## Error Console
1. Open the Error Console (via Tools > Web Developer)
2. Copy & paste the contents of a file into the error console and "Evaluate".

## Scratchpad
1. Open the Scratchpad (via Tools > Scratchpad)
2. Copy & paste the contents of a file into the editor.
3. Set Scratchpad to use the Browser environment (via the Environment menu)
4. Execute the code to show output (right click > Display or via the Execute menu)

Everything is very much ad hoc. I'm not building a library - there is code duplication to do similar things (eg. iterate over all windows & tabs).


# Contribute

Feel free to fork & add your own scripts. Or make mine better. Or if you want to tackle any TODOs there might be, go for it.
