# Be Warned

Some of these will have destructive & irreversible actions. You will probably not have any warning other than comments or the name of the script (hint: "remove" will remove things!)


# Usage

All of these can be run from the error console. Copy & paste the contents of a file into the error console and run.

Everything is very much ad hoc. I'm not building a library - there is code duplication to do similar things (eg. iterate over all windows & tabs).


# Contribute

Feel free to fork & add your own scripts. Or make mine better. Or if you want to tackle any TODOs there might be, go for it.
